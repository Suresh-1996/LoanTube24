              1. Determine Why You Need to Borrow
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 text-justify">
              Before applying for a loan, ask yourself: Is this borrowing
              necessary? Loans should be taken for essential reasons such as
              medical emergencies, education, home improvements, or business
              investments. Avoid borrowing for non-essential expenses like
              luxury shopping or vacations unless you have a solid repayment
              plan.

              Many borrowers sign loan agreements without fully understanding
